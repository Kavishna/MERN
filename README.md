# MERN Project

A simple MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) app that allows you to perform CRUD operations. The main goals of this project are:

1. **Refresh Redux**: Reinforce knowledge of Redux and its implementation in a MERN stack application.
2. **Build a REST API**: Create a robust RESTful API using Express.js and MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
3. **Image Upload**: Learn how to upload and handle image files in a server-side environment.

## Deployment

The REST API is deployed on Render.com. You can access the project by visiting [https://kavishna.github.io/MERN/](https://kavishna.github.io/MERN/). Please note that the initial loading of data may take a few seconds as the server terminates after 15 minutes of inactivity.

## Troubleshooting

If the ads are not being displayed, it is recommended to disable any ad blockers that might be active. Ad blockers sometimes interfere with the rendering of content, especially when keywords like "ads" are used in the project.

Thank you for your understanding, and enjoy exploring the MERN project!
